# DOMO Challenge

I decided to tackle the challenge corresponding to image number 4 in [Domo Frontend Challenge](https://domofrontendchallenge.netlify.app/), using **TypeScript** and **Next.js** with a focus on maximizing performance. My main goal was to achieve a perfect score of 100 across all Lighthouse metrics, which I successfully accomplished by making the following key decisions:


### Key Decisions and Technologies

- **Next.js**: I utilized Next.js to showcase my adaptability to the latest technologies while taking advantage of its performance optimization features.
- **TypeScript**: I chose TypeScript to maintain cleaner, more debuggable code and reduce errors during development.
- **Form Handling**: I implemented form handling using **React Hook Form**, allowing efficient validation and creating a simulation of what a form submission would look like.
- **Dynamic Routing with Next.js Router**: I added dynamic routes using Next.js Router to provide smooth navigation and improve the user experience.
- **Minimalist Animations**: I implemented subtle hover animations for buttons while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic of the original design.
- **Image Optimization**: I converted the image to **SVG** and optimized it for better performance without sacrificing visual quality.
- **Component Distribution**: The code is organized into reusable components, making it easier to maintain and update in the future.
- **Deployed on Railway**: The application is deployed on my **Railway** service, ensuring fast and efficient delivery.
